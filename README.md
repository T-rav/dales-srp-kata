# Single Responsibility Principle

*A class should have only one reason to change*

## Overview of this repo

Inside you will find the beginnings of a ground-breaking new RPG game. Unfortunately in the rush to get features completed the main
RpgPlayer class is starting to turn into a hair-ball of responsibilities.

## Getting started

1. Clone.
2. Build.
3. Run the tests.

## Assessing the current solution

Even though the public interface for the RpgPlayer looks nice and tidy, the nightmare exists behind the scenes.

The __Player__ has far too much knowledge about what the items are capable of, though initially this may have seemed like a good place to
put the logic as the items are *mostly* acting on the player.
